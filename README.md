## Description

-Place Heroku link here-

Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls, step right up and behold the marvel of the modern web development world, "Your so MEARN!" This spectacle of an application is a testament to the power of data and user demands, the twin pillars that drive the digital circus we call the internet.

My challenge,facing the danger head on, was to take this fully functioning Google Books API search engine, built with a RESTful API, and transform it into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This app, a marvel of the MEARN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API, is already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

So, step right up and see the the challenge that was faced inside the repo! The digital circus awaits you!

## Installation

Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls, gather round as I unveil the steps to master the marvel that is "Your so MEARN!" Follow these instructions, and you'll be the ringmaster of your own digital circus in no time!

1. **The Apollo Server Setup**: Like a lion tamer, you'll need to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API. Fear not, for this beast is tamed with knowledge and precision!

2. **The Authentication Modification**: Next, like a skilled acrobat, you'll need to modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API. It's a daring act of balance and agility, but I have faith in your abilities!

3. **The Apollo Provider Creation**: Now, like a juggler, you'll need to create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server. Keep your eyes on the balls and your hands steady, and you'll pull off this trick with ease!

4. **The Grand Finale - Deployment**: Finally, like the grand finale of our show, deploy the application to Heroku. With a drumroll and a flourish, your application will take to the digital stage for all to see!

Remember, the show must go on! So step right up, take the reins, and let's get this digital circus on the road!
